         <p>My love,</p>

         <p>Happy Monthsary, today marks the 4 months of our relationship. The day we became one and decided to be with each other forever. A wonderful and dreamy 2025 ended, and we step into a new year together. 2025 was really special for me, the year in which I met you, and felt what it means to be loved. It was a year of lessons, which started harshly and completely transformed into the most memorable year all coz I met you. You guided me, stood by me whenever I felt low, and motivated me. Love, you are my biggest strength, and with your love and prayers, I feel protected. I don’t have the words to describe how much you mean to me, every word that I think of seems less to justify the kindness, care, humility, and pure-hearted you are. I hope you are happy with me, and I’ll keep improving myself so that you can always be proud of choosing me, and I can always keep you happy. I’ll give my best so that not a tear comes to your eyes. You made me feel like the most loved person on earth, and you keep showering your love. You have been fighting your silent battles alone, but now I want to be with you in all your hardships. Together, we will overcome all difficulties and grow towards achieving our goals. The most important thing for me is to be with you soon. All I want is to be your safe place, a person whom you can share all your feelings with, and feel like home with me.</p>

         <p>We entered the new year together on the video call, a truly magical moment for me. It made me feel like I was there with you, and all I wished in that moment was to hug you, see you smiling, enjoying. I miss you very much, crave to see you, sit beside you and just stare at you, hug you, care for you when you are unwell. I really hope that this year I can visit you and spend a few days with you, and I’ll try my best to make it happen. Love, I promise that I’ll become better, follow the advices that you gave, so you don’t get worried, and I can be the person who gives you all the happiness you deserve. This year we will grow together, our love getting stronger and stronger, take care of each other, and I pray that god keeps you always healthy and eases your way towards your dreams. I can’t wait for the day we get married and then never have to say bye and good night on text. My biggest blessing from god is you, and I am so eagerly waiting the day we officially become husband and wife. I am yearning to be with you very much and soon I am going to visit you. Thank you so much, love.</p>

         <p>I love you</p>

          <p>With all my heart,<br>— Akash</p>
